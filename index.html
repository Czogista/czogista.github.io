                <h1>Hi, I‚Äôm <block id="maleka">Kacper</block> üëã</h1>
                <p>
                    I‚Äôm a tech enthusiast passionate about web development, design, and building things that reflect
                    me and my interests. I‚Äôm currently a student and casier as part-time job, but I‚Äôve been coding
                    since I was 12 years old in shool when we learn Scratch in IT classes, and I‚Äôve been hooked ever
                    since and learned a lot along the way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hold a professional qualification in creating and managing websites, web apps, and databases ‚Äî
                    so while I might not call myself a full-on pro (yet!), I‚Äôm definitely a <span
                        class="highlight">programmer in progress</span>.</p>
                <p>
                    When I‚Äôm not coding, I‚Äôm probably deep in a games (yes, I‚Äôve racked up thousands of hours),
                    running my community, improveing my skills, or just hanging out with friends.
                    <br>You can visit the ‚ÄúMy Projects‚Äù tab to learn more about my work and the projects I‚Äôm
                    currently involved in and sharing publicly.

                    Its small discord community that I created in 2019 when I was just 14 years old and develop it until
                    now, which has grown to almost 100 members so far. Yeah, not much but main invinte link was used
                    over 900 times, so I hope that memer count will grow in the future.<br>
                    <br>I also created a website for it, which is not so advanced, but it works and looks good. You can
                    find it at <a href="https://nnamesquad.top" target="_blank"
                        style="color: var(--nns);">nnamesquad.top</a> or just join the <a

                    FlagBar is a browser extension that adds colors of LGBT-flags to YouTube, making it more
                    personalized and visually appealing. It‚Äôs a fun little project I‚Äôve been working on, and you can
                    check it out at <a href="https://flagbar.nnamesquad.top" target="_blank"

                    <br>Whant to ask why I created it? Well, I was bored and wanted to do something with my free time,
                    and this idea come to my mind because of one of my friends who is coneccted with LGBT community and
                    I wanted to do something for them, but when I started working on it, I realized that it can be
                    useful for everyone, so I decided to make it public and share it with the world.
